# Rooster Color

A Chrome extension that enables custom colors for courses on [rooster.rug.nl](https://rooster.rug.nl) 



## Installation

As the extension is not available in the Chrome Webstore (yet) it must be installed as an unpacked extension.

* Download and unzip the [latest release](https://github.com/tijnedens/rooster-color/archive/refs/tags/v1.0.0.zip) from this github page.
* Open Chrome and go to *chrome://extensions* (enter it in the address bar).
* Enable developer mode (at the top right of this page).
* Select **Load Unpacked**.
* Now select the unpacked folder called '*rooster-color-\<version\>*'.
* Extension should now be installed and displayed on the extensions page.
## Usage

When visiting [rooster.rug.nl](https:rooster.rug.nl), open the extension UI by pressing the small jigsaw icon in the top left menu bar and clicking on the extension.

> Tip: You can pin the extension to the menu bar. 
> * Just click on the jigsaw icon to open the extensions menu.
> * Then press the small pin icon next to the extension name.
